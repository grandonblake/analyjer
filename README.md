# AnalyJer
AnalyJer: Market Review Analyzer

It is an AI tool that analyzes product reviews to provide businesses with insights into customer sentiments. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and Sentiment Analysis to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, and presents the data in a graph format. It utilized Python Flask and the AliExpress API using libraries such as spacy, nltk, transformers, torch, and plotly.

This project was a group effort that was submitted on July 14, 2023 as a Final Project requirement during my 3rd year in College.

## About
Introducing AnalyJer, an advanced market reviewing AI designed to analyze  product reviews and present insightful data in an easily interpretable graph format. With AnalyJer, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer sentiments and make data-driven decisions to enhance their products and services. AnalyJer utilizes cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to read and understand product reviews from various sources, such as e-commerce platforms, social media, and review websites. It applies sentiment analysis techniques to assess whether the reviews are positive or negative based on the overall tone and context of the text. The AI-powered system then compiles the analyzed data into a comprehensive graph, providing an intuitive visualization of the sentiment distribution. The graph displays the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral reviews, allowing businesses to quickly assess the overall customer sentiment and identify trends.

## Objectives
- To develop a robust and advanced AI-powered market intelligence tool utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze and extract insights from product reviews.
- To implement sentiment analysis techniques to assess the overall tone and context of the reviews, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- To evaluate the effectiveness by compiling and visualizing the analyzed data into an easily interpretable graph format, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights into customer sentiments and make data-driven decisions to enhance their products and services.

## Significance
The study on AnalyJer and its application in market intelligence contributes to the existing frontiers of knowledge by bridging the gap between the abundance of customer reviews and the ability of businesses to extract valuable insights.

Through the insights generated by AnalyJer, consumers can access a visual representation of sentiment distribution and trends for products, helping them gauge the overall satisfaction levels of other customers. This allows consumers to make more informed choices and increases trust and transparency in the marketplace.
- Future developers: The research contributes to the development community by serving as a foundation for further advancements in market intelligence systems. The methodologies and techniques employed in AnalyJer can serve as a basis for future developers to build upon, enhancing the capabilities of AI-powered systems and expanding the range of applications within the field. This benefits the broader technological landscape and stimulates innovation in the domain of Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis.

## Libraries and API used
- Flask: Flask is a web framework in Python used for creating web applications. In this project, Flask is utilized to develop the user interface and handle HTTP requests and responses.
- spacy: Spacy is a popular Python library used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides functionalities for tokenization, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and more. In this project, spacy is used for text processing and analysis of customer reviews.
- plotly.graph_objects and plotly.express: Plotly is a visualization library that offers interactive and aesthetically pleasing graphs and charts. plotly.graph_objects and plotly.express provide functionalities for creating and customizing various types of graphs. In this project, they are used to generate comprehensive visualizations, such as sentiment distribution graphs, based on the analyzed data.
- nltk.tokenize, nltk.corpus, and nltk.stem: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a library in Python specifically designed for NLP tasks. nltk.tokenize is used for tokenizing text into individual words or sentences, nltk.corpus provides access to different language corpora and stopword lists, and nltk.stem is used for word stemming and lemmatization. In this project, these modules are used for text preprocessing and improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis.
- transformers.pipeline and transformers.AutoTokenizer: Transformers is a popular library developed by Hugging Face that provides access to state-of-the-art pre-trained models for NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. transformers.pipeline enables easy access to various pipelines like sentiment analysis, while transformers.AutoTokenizer is used to tokenize and preprocess text data to be fed into the models. These modules are used in this project to perform sentiment analysis on the customer reviews.
- torch: Torch is a powerful machine learning library that offers various tools and modules for building and training deep learning models. In this project, torch is used in conjunction with transformers to deploy pre-trained models for sentiment analysis.
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) - is a popular pre-trained language model developed by Google. It revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks by introducing a bidirectional context understanding approach.
- AliExpress API: AliExpress is an online retail platform owned by Alibaba Group, one of the world's largest e-commerce companies. It serves as a marketplace connecting international buyers with sellers primarily based in China and other countries. It is utilized to fetch the data and customer reviews from AliExpress, allowing for real-time analysis and insights. The API provides access to the necessary data for training and evaluating the AnalyJer system.
